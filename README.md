- 👋 Hi, I’m Aida Rezaei! A girl with bigggg dreams who is trying to climb up the bioinformatic ladders!
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, programming, learning new languages, swimming, reading poems, and kittens. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bioinformatics, advanced R programming, and courses that I will/am (depending on if you are reading it in summer) taking at university.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of bioinformatic project or activity (R, python, etc... I will do it WELL! don't worry :D). 
- 📫 You can reach me via aida.rezaei@ug.bilkent.edu.tr (university emaill, I prefer this one actually!) or aiiida.ar2003@gmail.com (personal email in case you couldn't reach me with my university email)
- Thanks! Take care!! :)
